# Tailwind SaaS Landing Page

A simple, responsive SaaS landing page built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

This project contains a single HTML file (`insex.html`) that showcases a modern SaaS landing page design. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, loaded via CDN for quick prototyping.

## Features

- Responsive navbar with navigation links
- Hero section with call-to-action buttons
- Gradient background and modern design
- Mobile-friendly layout

## Usage

1. Open `insex.html` in your web browser.
2. The page will load with all styles applied via Tailwind CSS CDN.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection (for Tailwind CSS CDN)

## Customization

- Edit `insex.html` to modify the content, colors, or layout.
- For production use, consider installing Tailwind CSS locally and building the CSS file.

## Troubleshooting

- If styles don't load, check your internet connection for the Tailwind CDN.
- Ensure the HTML file is opened directly in a browser (not served from a local server, unless CORS is configured).
